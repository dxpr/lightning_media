## 4.1.0
* Fixed bugs introduced in Lightning Media 4.0 that could occur when updating from very old versions of Lightning.
* Deprecated the dependency on Views Infinite Scroll. It will *NOT* be included in Lightning Media 5.0, so if you need to continue using it in your project, you will need to add it to your composer.json. For example: `composer require drupal/views_infinite_scroll:^1.6`.
* The image browser has been split into its own separate view, called "Image Browser". This change will not affect existing sites.
