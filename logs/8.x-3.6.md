## 3.6.0
* The media browser is now displayed in a modal dialog by default, which is
  activated by pressing the "Add media" button. When embedding media in the
  WYSIWYG editor, the media browser is unchanged (the entity browser used for
  WYSIWYG has been split out into a completely separate entity browser
  configuration in order to facilitate this). (GitHub #80)
