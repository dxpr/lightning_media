## 4.0.0-beta1
* Lightning Media now uses the core Media Library module in place of the media
  browser by default. All media types packaged with Lightning Media now support
  the core Media Library module out of the box. Media Library is also now the
  default way of embedding media into WYSIWYG text editors, so Lightning Media
  no longer has a hard dependency on the Entity Embed module.
* Lightning Media Video now uses the core oEmbed system by default and no
  longer has a hard dependency on the Video Embed Field module. Existing
  sites are not affected by this change.
* Made the Document field required on the Document media type.
* Updated the Slick Entity Reference module to 2.0.
* Lightning Media no longer includes Libraries API as a dependency.
* Updated DropzoneJS to 2.1.
* Updated Entity Browser to 2.3.
