## 3.5.0
* Updated Lightning Core to 3.5, which security updates Drupal core to 8.6.6.
* Added a configuration option to control whether newly-created media fields 
  (i.e., entity reference fields which reference media items) will be configured 
  to use the media browser by default. (Issue #2945153)
* The "Show in media library" field is no longer translatable by default in any
  media type included with Lightning Media. (Issue #3014913)
* Changes were made to the internal testing infrastructure, but nothing that
  will affect users of Lightning Media.
