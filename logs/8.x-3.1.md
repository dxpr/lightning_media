## 3.1.0
* Added a new component, Media Slideshow, which allows you to create
  slideshows and carousels of assets from your media library using the
  Slick JavaScript library. (#52)
* Lightning Media now has the Media Library module as an explicit
  dependency.
* In Quick Edit, it's now possible to remove images selected with the
  media browser. (#53)
